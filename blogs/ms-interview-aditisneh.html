                Microsoft came to our campus for the SWE-1 role. A total of 300+
                students applied for its recruitment drive. I was also one of
                the applicants. Round-1: Round 1 was an Online Test for a
                duration of one hour. It was hosted on the Codility platform,
                which is generally used by Microsoft. It had two coding
                questions based entirely on DSA. Although the topics involving
                the questions were a bit on the difficult side, the questions
                were relatively easy. After Round 1, Microsoft shortlisted
                around 30 students for the interview rounds. Round 2 (Technical
                Round): Round 2 was technical in nature. It was held on
                Microsoft teams. The interviewer greeted me and asked me to tell
                him about myself. It is a good idea to have a proper
                introduction written and practiced beforehand. Make sure that
                you always end your introduction with a project or a work
                experience that you are confident in. The interviewer generally
                asks a follow-up question on that. This way you can guide the
                interviewer to a topic you are comfortable with. I was asked two
                questions related to DSA: The first question was to find an
                element in an m x n matrix, sorted row-wise and column-wise. You
                can find the question here:
                https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/
                . I was asked to come up with the most optimized approach, i.e.
                in O(m+n) time complexity, and write the code for it. I started
                with a brute-force approach and worked my way to find an
                optimized solution which I eventually reached. I dry ran my code
                with sample test cases, which were passed. He was satisfied with
                my answer. The second question was a previous year’s Microsoft
                question, the Gas Station problem:
                https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/ . I was asked to just
                explain the logic and pseudocode for this question. I explained
                it using sample test cases and he was satisfied with my answer.
                He was done with his questions as the time was up and asked me
                if I had any questions for him. After a while, I was called for
                Round 3. Round 3 (Technical Round): Round 3 was also technical
                in nature. The interviewer asked me to tell him about myself and
                asked follow-up questions about my previous internships. He then
                proceeded to ask me questions related to Object Oriented
                Programming concepts. What are abstract classes and interfaces?
                Which of them provides more abstraction? How would you implement
                Multiple Inheritance in Java and C++? He asked me questions
                related to Inheritance Upcasting and Down-casting in Java. He
                asked me a DSA question after this, which was very easy. A total
                of 10 students were selected for the final round. Round 4 (AA
                Round – Technical + HR): The AA round is the final round in any
                Microsoft interview. It is conducted by a senior official from
                Microsoft and its main aim is to verify the evaluations of the
                previous interview round and ask some HR questions. The
                interviewer asked me to tell him about myself and asked some
                detailed questions related to my internship. He then gave me a
                DSA question: Given a number N, and a sorted array A, find the
                possible combinations of the elements of A that add up to N. The
                numbers can be repeated at any time and there is no constraint
                on the size of the combination. I was able to give a
                semi-optimized approach but I struggled with the optimized
                solution. Even though he gave me a few hints, I was unable to
                find the most optimized approach. He then proceeded to ask me
                some HR-related questions which were majorly situation based.
                For any situation-based question, it is best to follow the STAR
                approach: Situation, Task, Action, Result. I was asked about the
                time I felt like a failure, and how I rose from it. Just take
                any real experience from your life (preferably) and break it
                into STAR components. He then asked me if I had any questions.
                Microsoft recruited two students from our campus. Although I was
                not one of them, I thought that the interview experience was
                worthy enough to be shared, as most of the interview experiences
                from GeeksForGeeks helped me plan my approach toward the
                placements of any company. Final Notes: Prepared topics like DSA
                and OOPs concepts thoroughly. Most questions are asked from here
                and your approach will be appreciated more than the final
                answer. While ideating a solution for a DSA question, make sure
                that you think out loud as this help the interviewer know about
                your thought process and your decision-making skill. It also
                keeps the interviewer interested and engaged. For any
                situational HR question, always use the STAR method to answer,
                as it is the most accepted convention and clearly provides the
                information the interviewer wants to know about you. The
                interviewers are generally friendly and make you feel
                comfortable while giving the interview. If you are stuck on a
                question, you can always ask for hints for proceeding further.
